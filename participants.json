Every type of contraception that was on the market, that was going to come on the market, what has been on the market, what they used in, Cleopatra used and everything. We were just told everything, and our teacher was very good, she told us about her experiences.  She told us all about orgasms and stuff like that.",

One was I should say she was thirty, and was say about near enough retirement age, and the younger one would talk about it freely and the older one would turn around and say, 'before I met MRS WILLIAMS I didn’t even know what an orgasm was. And I thought crabs were things that walked sideways over the beach’. It used to be dead informal and we also had discussions about mixed racial marriages and stuff like that. I remember a discussion about abortion. We used to do role play.",

I could have killed him I was so annoyed.",

To think that they are wrong, and it’s just the way they are, like some people their hormonal balance is wrong and everything.",

It was dead good and they used to have loads of pamphlets and everything. They had a small room the size of your wardrobe with all different things, and we used to have a goody box, I remember the goody box, it had caps and condoms, coils and everything. And they used to have stuff on pieces of paper and show you what to do with them, you know real ones not just pictures. It was really good."

And so when we used to go out I used to have to pay, so he didn’t like that because he used to have to pay £20 to his dad and he had £15 for himself all week, and that was his dinners and everything, so I used to pay for everything.

                "He just said do you want to go out for a drink just together and then we went, but even then nothing came of it for a long time afterwards and then obviously then it started to develop and then we just started sleeping together. And yes, it was so unexpected that no it was never discussed and yes, I was extremely worried. More so the fact that I had slept with him rather than I might be pregnant.",
                "Well it was Christmas, he came home for Christmas and I realised that this was going to carry on and we were getting a lot closer and I thought I've got to do something about this so I did. But that was the most harrowing experience of my life because I went to the family planning clinic and never, ever, ever again will I go to such a place.",
                "I thought it was the most harrowing experience of my whole life. I made an appointment and it’s just down the road here. And I made this appointment for seven o'clock or something and I got there and there was everybody there that I knew and I was sat there with my head in my hands, it was horrible. And people were there who I knew and I had to sit and wait and it was about quarter past nine before I got in and did anything and I had made an appointment for seven o'clock and I was absolutely furious because I don't suffer fools very easily and I hate situations like that. And I hated just sort of everybody knowing. It was awful. And so I went in to see the nurse and it was just like being on a production line and I thought this, I just can't stand this and then I went in to see the doctor who was a foreign doctor and he was just awful. He was just so clinical and in fact I was near to tears and he said, you don't look very happy and that was the first face to face thing he said and that was as I was walking out the door. And I said, no I'm not, and I walked out and in fact I was in tears, I was so upset, it was awful. And so I went on this pill which was absolutely dreadful, it made me so poorly, I was in a right state. I can't remember what it was called now but it was three different stages.",
                "I hate going to the doctors anyway and I went to see him one Saturday morning because I was feeling so ill Friday before and I phoned and he said come down, and bring your pills with you and I'll sort it out. And he was really, really nice about it. He was dead friendly and explained everything and he was really, really nice.",
                "I also felt after that, that I should have gone on the pill a long time ago and I couldn't.. I realised how stupid it was and I know what my reaction would have been had someone told me the same instance, and so I just thought, I'll go on the pill and get it all sorted out. And I think a lot of it was because I was frightened initially. But then when I'd gone to the doctors I had spoken to people about it by then."

If there's no way up in the job that you're doing you just move around and you get up in another way. And at the moment they are really striving for young people, young people are the bees knees at the moment where it used to be if you'd been there fifty years then you've earned the respect, but you know now it’s like."

                "There were always people called slags yes, but not particularly my friends because they didn't really fall into the category of slags. There were people who would sleep around and people who would sleep with the lads they were seeing. I think there is a difference really.",

I couldn't do it because I couldn't handle it but I would never shun anyone else for it. Why I am more worried about my friend DEBORAH is because I think she's only doing it because she's looking for something more stable really. And that’s why I'm worried about her, but no I wouldn't shun anyone because of it, if that’s...",
                "A lot of my friends are Catholics and one in particular is a devout Catholic and she well, actually we were at her house playing a game, scruples, and one of the cards is what would you do if you were pregnant and didn't want it. Oh I tell you that was like one of the first questions in the game and the game stopped from there on because her parents were there and all her family and there was me and one of the lads that was there and we were the only people who were saying, well, just hang on a minute, you know. Oh it was murder, but I think to myself, I think because she's Catholic, because they're all exactly the same. They all went to the same school, the Catholic school and they were all exactly the same thinking, even the more liberal of them. They must absolutely drum it into them. I think it’s disgraceful. I mean we had it drummed into us."

But it never happened, we never sat down and said this is what happens and if you ever get into trouble do this, you know what I mean, that never happened."
